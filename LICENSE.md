     * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
     * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
     * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
     * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
     * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
     * the properties of the two independent implementations.
     *
     * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
     * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
     * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
     * compile-time configuration.
