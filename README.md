# End of Life Notice
The legacy MongoDB PHP driver (i.e. `ext-mongo`) is now officially end-of-life (EOL). No further development, bugfixes, enhancements, documentation changes or maintenance will be provided by this project and pull requests will no longer be accepted.

Users are encouraged to migrate to [mongodb/mongo-php-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver) (i.e. `ext-mongodb`). 

For historical reference, the documentation for this project has been archived in the `docs/` folder and may be viewed at: https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-php-driver-legacy/

----

## Installation

To build and install the driver:

    phpize
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Then, add the following to your `php.ini` file:

    extension=mongo.so

### Enabling enterprise features

To connect to MongoDB Enterprise using SASL (GSSAPI) or LDAP (PLAIN) you need
to build the driver against cyrus-sasl2 (external library).
This is done by passing --with-mongo-sasl to ./configure, optionally passing
in the directory to where cyrus-sasl2 was installed:

    phpize
    ./configure --with-mongo-sasl=/usr/local
    make
    sudo make install

### Installing on Windows

Windows builds are available through http://pecl.php.net/package/mongo.

Builds for older driver versions may be found through
https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivers.mongodb.org/php/index.html.

Each driver release includes various builds to support specific versions of PHP
and Windows. Select the correct DLL file for your environment, and add the
following to your `php.ini` file (`VERSION` will vary by environment):

    extension=php_mongo-VERSION.dll

If the DLL is not located within the directory specified by the
[extension_dir](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.extension-dir) INI
setting, you may need to specify its full path.

## Documentation

This extension's documentation was previously hosted on PHP.net but has since
been removed. The final version of the documentation is now published in the
``docs/`` folder of this repository and available via GitHub pages:
https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-php-driver-legacy/

## How To Ask For Help

When asking for support, or while providing feedback in the form of bugs or
feature requestes, please include the following relevant information:

 - Detailed steps on how to reproduce the problem, including a script that
   reproduces your problem, if possible. 
 - The exact PHP version used. You can find this by running `php -v` on the
   command line, or by checking the output of `phpinfo();` in a script
   requested through a web server.
 - The exact version of the MongoDB driver for PHP. You can find this by
   running `php --ri mongo | grep Version` on the command line, or by running
   a script containing `<?php echo phpversion("mongo"); ?>`.
 - The operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7, OSX 10.8, ...).
 - How you installed the driver, either via your distribution's package
   management, with "brew", with an \*AMP installation package, or through a
   manual source compile and install.
 - With connection and replica set selection issues, please also provide a
   full debug log. See further down on how to make one.



### Support / Feedback

For issues with, questions about, or feedback for the PHP driver, please look
into our [support channels](http://www.mongodb.org/about/support). Please do
not email any of the PHP driver developers directly with issues or
questions—you're more likely to get an answer on the 
[mongodb-user list](http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user) on Google
Groups.


### Bugs / Feature Requests

Think you have found a bug? Want to see a new feature in the driver? Please
open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:

 - Create an account and login (https://jira.mongodb.org).
 - [Create a new issue](https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?pid=10007).

Bug reports in JIRA for all driver projects, as well as for the MongoDB server
project, are **public**. Please do not add private information to bug reports.


## Security Vulnerabilities

If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the 
[instructions here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report).


## Testing

The tests are not available as part of the PECL package, but they are available 
on [Github](http://www.github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/tree/master/tests).  

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to run and create new tests.


## Full debug log

You can make a full debug log by using the following code:


```php
<?php
/*
 * This script will catch all internal driver logging for MongoDB and log them
 * to a file /tmp/MONGO-PHP-LOG.<unix-timestamp>. This log will give the
 * driver developers more or less all the information they'll need to debug
 * this issue
 */
 
function module2string($module)
{
    switch ($module) {
        case MongoLog::RS: return "REPLSET";
        case MongoLog::CON: return "CON";
        case MongoLog::IO: return "IO";
        case MongoLog::SERVER: return "SERVER";
        case MongoLog::PARSE: return "PARSE";
        default: return $module;
    }
}
 
function level2string($level)
{
    switch ($level) {
        case MongoLog::WARNING: return "WARN";
        case MongoLog::INFO: return "INFO";
        case MongoLog::FINE: return "FINE";
        default: return $level;
    }
}
 
function logMongo($module, $level, $message, $save = false) {
    static $log = "";
    $log .= sprintf("%s | %s (%s): %s\n", date('Y-m-d H:i:s',time()), module2string($module), level2string($level), $message);
 
    if ($save) {
        file_put_contents("/tmp/MONGO-PHP-LOG." . time(), $log);
        $log = "";
    }
}
 
function saveMongoLogException($ex) {
    if ($ex instanceof MongoException) {
        $msg = sprintf("Uncaught exception: %s, %s\n",  get_class($ex), $ex->getMessage());
        logMongo(get_class($ex), "ERROR", $ex->getMessage(), true);
    }
    throw $ex;
}

function saveMongoLog() {
    logMongo("EXIT", "EXIT", "EXIT", true);
}
 
MongoLog::setLevel(MongoLog::ALL);
MongoLog::setModule(MongoLog::ALL);
MongoLog::setCallback("logMongo");

register_shutdown_function("saveMongoLog");
 
/* If an global exception handler is used, or a default exception handler is
 * already registered, please comment out this line and put into your catch
 * block: saveMongoLogException($exception); */
set_exception_handler("saveMongoLogException");
?>
```
