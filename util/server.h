/**
 * Handles state information about a single server.
 *
 * If someone connects to a server and the driver can figure out that this
 * server is either equivalent to one already connected to or referred to by a
 * different name in the replica set, then there will be one "info guts" struct
 * holding information about this server.  Other info structs will point to this
 * structs guts.
 *
 * Server info is derived by two calls: once ever ISMASTER_INTERVAL, ismaster is
 * called to determine if this is a primary or secondary, BSON object size, etc.
 * Once every PING_INTERVAL seconds, ping is called to just determine if the
 * server is up or down.  We assume it's in the same state it was on last
 * ismaster check.
 *
 * TODO:
 * If a primary gets a "not master" error, it should become unreadable and
 * unwritable until the next ismaster call.  If a slave gets a "not secondary"
 * error, it should become unreadable until the next ismaster.
